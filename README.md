This project is a web-based interest calculator built using FastAPI and Python.
It allows users to enter given date, release date, principal amount, and additional interest paid.
The calculator follows a 12% annual interest rate, uses a 30-day month convention, applies round-half-up logic, and provides accurate calendar month calculations.
Designed for quick access on mobile and desktop via a simple web interface.
